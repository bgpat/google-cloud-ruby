# google-cloud-translate

[Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translation/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/translation/docs)) provides a simple, programmatic interface for translating an arbitrary string into any supported language. It is highly responsive, so websites and applications can integrate with Translation API for fast, dynamic translation of source text. Language detection is also available in cases where the source language is unknown.

Translation API supports more than one hundred different languages, from Afrikaans to Zulu. Used in combination, this enables translation between thousands of language pairs. Also, you can send in HTML and receive HTML with translated text back. You don't need to extract your source text or reassemble the translated content.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-translate
```

## Authentication

Like other Cloud Platform services, Google Cloud Translation API supports
authentication using a project ID and OAuth 2.0 credentials. In addition,
it supports authentication using a public API access key. (If both the API
key and the project and OAuth 2.0 credentials are provided, the API key
will be used.) Instructions and configuration options are covered in the
[Authentication Guide](./AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/translate"

translate = Google::Cloud::Translate.new

translation = translate.translate "Hello world!", to: "la"

puts translation #=> Salve mundi!

translation.from #=> "en"
translation.origin #=> "Hello world!"
translation.to #=> "la"
translation.text #=> "Salve mundi!"
```

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library. The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below, or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest/Google/Cloud/Logging/Logger) that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb) and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.3+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or in
security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.3 and
later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
